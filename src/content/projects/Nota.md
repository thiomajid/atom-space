From the Latin word _Nota_ which means "Label", this project aims to provide an open-source solution that will allow data annotation in a collaborative manner but also automate the process leveraging **AI models**.

The project has three main goals:

- 🌍 Allow collaborative data annotation
- 🤖 Use AI models as annotators
- 📦 Support a wide range of data providers (local files, S3-based storage,...)
